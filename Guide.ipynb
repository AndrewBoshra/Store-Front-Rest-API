    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "This repo contains a basic Node and Express app to get you started in constructing an API. To get started, clone this repo and run `yarn` in your terminal at the project root.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Technologies\n",
    "Your application must make use of the following libraries:\n",
    "- Postgres for the database\n",
    "- Node/Express for the application logic\n",
    "- dotenv from npm for managing environment variables\n",
    "- db-migrate from npm for migrations\n",
    "- jsonwebtoken from npm for working with JWTs\n",
    "- jasmine from npm for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment\n",
    "#### Workspace\n",
    "This project can be done inside of this Udacity workspace. To ready your environment follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In a terminal tab, create and run the database:\n",
    "- switch to the postgres user `su postgres` \n",
    "- start psql `psql postgres`\n",
    "- in psql run the following:\n",
    "  - `CREATE USER shopping_user WITH PASSWORD 'password123';`\n",
    "  - `CREATE DATABASE shopping;`\n",
    "  - `\\c shopping`\n",
    "  - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE shopping TO shopping_user;`\n",
    "- to test that it is working run `\\dt` and it should output \"No relations found.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In the 2nd terminal:\n",
    "- install yarn `npm install yarn -g`\n",
    "- install db-migrate on the machine for terminal commands `npm install db-migrate -g`\n",
    "- check node version `node -v` - it needs to be 10 or 12 level\n",
    "- *IF node was not 10 or 12 level, run* \n",
    "  - `npm install -g n`\n",
    "  - `n 10.18.0`\n",
    "  - `PATH=\"$PATH\"`\n",
    "  - `node -v` to check that the version is 10 or 12\n",
    "- install all project dependencies `yarn`\n",
    "- to test that it is working, run `yarn watch` should show an app starting on `0.0.0.0:3000`"

    "In this repo there is a `REQUIREMENTS.md` document which outlines what this API needs to supply for the frontend, as well as the agreed upon data shapes to be passed between front and backend. This is much like a document you might come across in real life when building or extending an API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to read the requirements and update the document with the following:\n",
    "- Determine the RESTful route for each endpoint listed. Add the RESTful route and HTTP verb to the document so that the frontend developer can begin to build their fetch requests. **Example**: for a SHOW route: 'blogs/:id' [GET] \n",
    "\n",
